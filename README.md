# React Blockchain Ico

<!-- ![](preview.gif) -->

This is an example of a decoupled frontend app implemented with `React` and `Redux`, fetching data from multiple rest api endpoints

- You can find a [online demo here](https://inputs.now.sh/)

## :gear: Configuration

Modify configuration in `.env` (start by renaming `env.example` to `.env`, [wondering why?](https://codeburst.io/process-env-what-it-is-and-why-when-how-to-use-it-effectively-505d0b2831e7))


## :rocket: Getting started

After you have cloned the repository to your computer please run the following commands inside the project folder:

```bash
# install dependencies
yarn

# run the app (localhost:8080)
yarn start
```

## :construction: Test

To make sure the application works as expected you can run the test suite like this:

```bash
# runs all test files
yarn test

# with coverage report
yarn test --coverage

# watch
yarn test --watch

# run tests that match a spec-name (e.g `App` or `components/Form`)
yarn test name-of-spec

# update snapshots that are out of date
yarn test --updateSnapshot
```

> A full list of `jest` cli commands can be found [here](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/cli)

## :link: Redux Structure

You will find the `Redux` configuration in `src/store/index`

The redux store is organized in feature based modules, each module brings it's own actions and reducers

**Current modules:**
- `src/containers/App`
- `src/containers/Transactions`

> **Info:** More about different ways to structure your `Redux` project [here](https://redux.js.org/faq/code-structure)

## :link: Api's

This app uses multiple api endpoints to receive data
- Transactions
  - https://blockchain.brickblock.io/inputs or http://localhost:5000/db
- Transactions meta
  - https://bb-data.now.sh
- Crypto currency exchange rates
  - https://min-api.cryptocompare.com

```bash
# serve main data from local server (localhost:5000)
# you will need to set `isLocal` to true inside `src/Transactions/getTransactions.jsx`
yarn server 
```

## :rainbow: Prettier

Prettier is a code formatter that ensures that all outputted code conforms to a consistent style

Run the following command before each commit to make sure your changes are valid :nerd_face:

Formats all `Js/Jsx` files according to `prettier.config.js` presets

```bash
# format all files
yarn format
```

## :vertical_traffic_light: Linter

> 
> Code linting can be seen, in a more broad sense, as static code analysis.
> 
> [What's the difference between Lint and Prettier?](https://restishistory.net/blog/whats-the-difference-between-eslint-and-prettier.html)

Lints all `Js/Jsx` files according to `.eslintrc` presets

```bash
# lint all files
yarn lint
```

> **Note:** Before running `yarn lint`, please run `yarn format` first :wink:

## :factory: Build

If you wish to host this app, you will need to run the build command. After you've run the command, you will find the build artefacts in the `/dist` folder.

```bash
# build static files
yarn build
```

## :truck: Deploy to Zeit.co with `now`

If you wish, you can deploy this app to Zeit.co. To do so please configure the following settings before you hit `yarn deploy` 

> Info: It's also possible to host with any other providers (e.g. Heroku) which support `node.js` but you'll need to configure them on your own :cry:

1. Modify configuration in `.env` (start by renaming `env.example` to `.env`, [wondering why?](https://codeburst.io/process-env-what-it-is-and-why-when-how-to-use-it-effectively-505d0b2831e7))
2. Modify configuration in `now.json` (start by renaming `now.example.json` to `now.json`
3. Deploy!

> Info: `Zeit.co now` creates deployments with random url names. In order to properly configure `cors` it is recommended to create an `alias` for your domain. 
> 
> It's easy to do with the following command after deployment:
> 
> ```bash
> now alias {the-random-deployment-url} {alias-name}

Finally now you're ready to:

```bash
# deploy app to production
yarn deploy
```
> Info: This will run `format` and `lint` in the `prebuild` step, to make sure the deployed version is meeting the requirements.
>
> If you want to skip this step, you can remove the flag from the `prebuild` in `package.json/scripts`
